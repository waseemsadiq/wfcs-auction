  <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
  <p>The data controller for this platform is:</p>
  <p><strong>The Well Foundation</strong><br />Building 2, Unit C, Ground Floor, 4 Parklands Way, Eurocentral, Holytown, ML1 4WR<br />Registered office: 211B Main Street, Bellshill, ML4 1AJ, Scotland<br />Charity Registration No. SC040105<br />Email: <a href="mailto:info@wellfoundation.org.uk">info@wellfoundation.org.uk</a></p>
  <p>As the data controller, we are responsible for deciding how and why your personal data is processed. If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal data, please contact us using the details above.</p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Account and Registration Data</h3>
  <p>When you register on the platform, we collect your:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Full name;</li>
    <li>Email address;</li>
    <li>Password (stored as a one-way hash — we never store your plain-text password); and</li>
    <li>Whether you are a UK taxpayer (for Gift Aid purposes).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.2 Bidding and Transaction Data</h3>
  <p>When you place bids or make purchases, we record:</p>

  <h3>2.3 Payment Data</h3>
  <p>Payments are processed securely by <strong>Stripe</strong>, our payment processor. We do not store your card number, CVV, or full card details on our systems. Stripe processes payment data as an independent data controller subject to its own privacy policy. We receive only a transaction reference and payment status from Stripe.</p>
  <h3>2.4 Gift Aid Declarations</h3>
  <p>If you opt in to Gift Aid, we record your declaration, the date made, and the relevant transaction. This information is shared with HMRC when we claim Gift Aid and is retained for six years as required by HMRC.</p>
  <h3>2.5 Technical Data</h3>
  <p>We collect limited technical data for security and performance purposes, including IP address (at login and bid placement) and session identifiers via essential cookies.</p>

  <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>

    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (UK GDPR Article 6(1)(f)): to maintain platform security, detect and prevent fraud, and improve the platform — where our interests are not overridden by your rights; and</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> (UK GDPR Article 6(1)(a)): where we send you optional communications such as auction reminders, which you may withdraw at any time.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Administer Gift Aid declarations and submit claims to HMRC;</li>
    <li>Detect and prevent fraudulent or abusive activity; and</li>
    <li>Send auction-related notifications (with your consent where required).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use your data for automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal or similarly significant effects.</p>

    <li><strong>HMRC</strong>: Gift Aid declarations and relevant donor information, where Gift Aid is claimed;</li>
    <li><strong>Fulfilment</strong>: your name and delivery address may be shared with a donor or courier where necessary to arrange delivery of a won lot; and</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requirement</strong>: where we are under a legal obligation to disclose data (for example, to OSCR or law enforcement).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All third parties with whom we share personal data are required to handle it securely and in accordance with applicable data protection law.</p>

    <li><strong>Payment and transaction records</strong>: seven years, in line with HMRC guidance on financial record-keeping; and</li>
    <li><strong>Security logs</strong> (IP addresses, login events): 90 days.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After the applicable retention period, data is securely deleted or anonymised.</p>

  <h2>7. Cookies</h2>
  <p>We use only <strong>essential session cookies</strong> — small text files stored on your device to keep you logged in during your visit. We do not use advertising, tracking, or analytics cookies. No cookie consent banner is required as we rely only on strictly necessary cookies.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These include encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS), hashed passwords, and access controls limiting who can view personal data within our organisation.</p>
  <p>No method of transmission over the internet is completely secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and you provide it at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Our platform and data are hosted in the United Kingdom. Stripe may process payment data in the United States or other jurisdictions where Stripe operates, subject to appropriate safeguards (including standard contractual clauses or adequacy decisions). We do not otherwise transfer your data outside the UK.</p>

  <p>The WFCS Auction platform is not directed at children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 18. If you believe we have inadvertently collected data from a minor, please contact us immediately and we will delete it.</p>
